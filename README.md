# **Claudine's SQL Portfolio**

### Greetings! 

### I am delighted to showcase my SQL Portfolio in the fascinating world of data management and database querying. This portfolio is a compilation of my initial adventures with SQL, where I've been immersing myself in the fundamentals of this robust language and discovering its efficiency in handling data. 

### Throughout this portfolio, you will find a collection of SQL queries, data modeling exercises, and simple database management projects. While my skills are still evolving, I am excited to share my progress as I continue to build a solid foundation in SQL. 

### I look forward to your feedback and suggestions, as I am eager to learn and grow in this exciting field of data management and analysis.
