## In this project, we explore a huge collection of data about purchases and customers. We use different SQL queries that look at information from various tables, helping us discover important insights about how customers behave, their past orders, and other related data.

#01 How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT (orderID)
AS total_orders
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length (orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#02 How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 

SELECT COUNT (product)
AS iPhone_order
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product ='iPhone';

#03 Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 

SELECT DISTINCT acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cs
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS feb
ON cs.order_id = feb.orderID
WHERE length (order_id)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#04 Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 

SELECT DISTINCT (product), price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;

#05 What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#06 Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT (SUM (quantity)*price AS total_revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#07 How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT COUNT (DISTINCT cust.acctnum), AVG (quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid = cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#08 List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT product, SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY product;
